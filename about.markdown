What is Bayes Bike?
--------------------
An analysis of bicycle crash data to understand how to make biking safer, based on the NYC crash data and an enrichment of that data.

Why “Bayes Bike”?
-------------------
[Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes) was a statistician who devised a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) describing “the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. ” In our case, we are attempting to predict crashes ("pre-crash") based on any and all data we can obtain or infer, so that individual cyclists can bike defensively and city planners can more effectively intervene.  Also, Tom likes Bayes because, you know, alliteration. We reserve the right to use, or not use, any Baysian statistics.

Why are we doing this?
-----------------------
We're two data-driven New Yorkers on bikes trying to save lives and prevent injuries. Matthew has used up two of his nine lives on NYC streets. Tom lost his brother [Charlie to a bike crash](https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/05/06/arlington-bicyclist-killed-crash-charles-proctor/), and hopes for a future where no one has to go through such pain and suffering.

Who is this for?
-----------------
We’re crunching the data to extract actionable insights for individual cyclists and patterns for the DOT and bike advocates.

What's in the NYC crash dataset?
-----------------------------------
As per the [NYC Open Data website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95): "The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC" from 2012 to the present. Data is collected by police for "collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage." The fields include date & time, geolocation / address, details on injuries and deaths, contributing factors, and types of vehicles. As of summer 2021, the crash data contains some 1.79 million rows over 29 columns, where each row represents a crash.
